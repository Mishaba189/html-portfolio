<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>👋 Hi there! I’m Mishaba N, an Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate with a strong passion for technology
   and creativity. I’m currently working as a Full Stack Developer Intern (Flutter), where I build intuitive and responsive 
   digital experiences. With a background that bridges hardware and software, I enjoy solving problems, designing clean user 
   interfaces, and developing efficient, scalable solutions. I’m always eager to learn, explore new tools, and grow as a developer
    while turning ideas into impactful applications.</p>
